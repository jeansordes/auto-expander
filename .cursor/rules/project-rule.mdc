- **Always** keep the rendering code separated from the logic, so that you can easily test the logic without having to test the rendering
- When implementing a feature, you first need to add a requirement to support the feature request in the requirements section of `specs.md`
- Always favor a modular and functionnal approach (with pure functions and no side effects) so that we can more easily code tests
- If you want to check the whole project consistency, use "npm run ci"
